HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by servers to 
indicate the outcome of a request. They are grouped into five classes, 
with the first digit defining the class. For instance, 4xx codes 
signify client errors, while 5xx codes indicate server errors.


In the 4xx class, 401 and 403 are particularly noteworthy. 
The "401 Unauthorized" status code indicates that the request 
lacks valid authentication credentials. On the other hand, the 
"403 Forbidden" status code signifies that the server understands 
the request but refuses to fulfill it. These two stages in access 
control are usually considered as authentication and authorization.

The error 401 Unauthorized can be a bit confusing. While 401 
is an authentication error code, its description labels it as 
Unauthorized. Letâ€™s dive into the 401 code to understand it in detail.
